# Final Project Files

- `model.ipynb` - The neural network model
- `image_lib.py` - Functions for image creation
- `image_mapping.ipynb` - Initial testing of the image library
- `simulator_lib.py` - Functions for simulating cone cells
- `simulator.ipynb` - Examples of using the simulation library
- `data/` - saved cone cells of various eye types
- `imgs` - visualization images of model performance

# How to use
1. Make any configurations of `simulator_lib.py` constants (if desired, the current values are what we've seen as scientifically plausible)
2. Make any configuration in `model.ipynb`
3. Run through `model.ipynb`
