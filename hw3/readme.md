## Problem 1 - True-False

### 1. The solution of the stochastic integral $\int_0^T \mu dW_t$ is $\mu(W_T - W_0)$ and is a random variable itself.

### 2. The variance of a Wiener process with scale coefficient $\alpha = 1$ at time $t$ is $t^2$.

### 3. The standard Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM) assumes that evidence about a dominant alternative accumulates in discrete chunks over time.

### 4. The first passage time distribution has a closed-form probability density function, but its density can still be evaluated only numerically.

### 5. The Euler-Maruyama method can only be used to simulate linear stochastic systems.

### 6. For any Bayesian analysis, the prior will always have a smaller variance than the posterior.

### 7. In addition to good statistical practice, experimental validation of cognitive models is crucial for ensuring construct validity.

### 8. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods approximate a complex posterior distribution through a simpler, yet analytically tractable, distribution.

### 9. For most Bayesian problems, the more data we collect, the less influence does the prior exert on the resulting inferences.

### 10. The effective sample size (ESS) estimated from MCMC samplers differs from the total number of samples because the samples are not independent (i.e., exhibit non-zero autocorrelation).
