# Homework Assignment 4

## Problem 1 - True-False

### Direct $K$-fold cross-validation requires $K$ model re-fits, which may be computationally demanding, especially when inverse inference is costly

### Bayes factors (BFs) are *relative measures*, that is, they cannot differentiate between "equally good" and "equally bad" models.

### Marginal likelihoods and, by extension, Bayes factors (BFs) cannot be used to compare models with different likelihoods.

### Both the Binomial and the Dirichlet distribution can be formulated as special cases of the Multinomial distribution.

### Bayesian leav-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) relies on the posterior predictive distribution of left-out data points.

### The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) penalizes model complexity indirectly through the variance of a model's marginal likelihood.

### The log-predictive density (LPD) is a relative metric of model complexity.

### The LPD can be approximated by evaluating the likelihood of each posterior draw (e.g., as provided by an MCMC sampler) and taking the average of all resulting likelihood values.

### Bayes factors do not depend on the prior odds, that is, the ratio of prior model probabilities $p(M_1)/p(M_2)$.

## Problem 5 - Reflection

One take-away is how important statistics is in the modern age. So many different
disciplines utilize predictive models whether they realize it or not. Some examples
include medicine, weather, stock markets, and even traffic patterns. Not all of
them utilize Bayesian models, but they do utilize previous observations to predict
new data, which is fundamentally a statistical problem.

Another take-away is the importance of validating the results of models. This is
especially important because of how many different ways there are to validate them
and also because of how complex they are.
