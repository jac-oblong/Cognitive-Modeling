## Problem 1 - True-False

### 1. A random variable is discrete if its support is countable and there exists an associated probability density function (pdf)

### 2. Probability mass functions have a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 1

### 3. The set of all possible realizations of a random variable is called its probability density

### 4. The expected value of a discrete random variable is always part of its support, that is, $E[X] \in R_X$

### 5. Continuous random variables are functions which map points from the sample space to the real numbers

### 6. We can formulate most parametric Bayesian models as a generative process, by which we first sample from the likelihood and then use the synthetic data point to sample from the prior

### 7. The Bayesian posterior $p(\theta | y)$ for continuous parameter vectors $\theta\in\mathbb{R}^D$ is just another density function. That means, its integral $\int p(\theta | Y=y)d\theta \ne 1$ for some y

### 8. Each realization of a continuous random variable has a probability of zero
